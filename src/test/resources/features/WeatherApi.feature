  Scenario: A happy holidaymaker
    Given I like to holiday in "Sydney,AU"
    And I only like to holiday on "Thursday"
    When I look up the the weather forecast for the next 14 days
    Then I can see the max temperature on "Thursday" is always above 10 degrees in "Sydney,AU"
    And I can see that it won't be snowing for the next 14 days
